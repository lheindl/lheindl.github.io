    <p>

        Some things become such a part of us that we forget them.<br>
        I want because of what I wanted, and what I wanted, I wouldn’t want again.<br>
        The passing of a soul is light, extremely light, almost silence.<br>
        There are pains that have lost their memory and don’t remember why they are painful.<br>
        Convince me, but without convictions. Convictions no longer convince me.<br>
        We don’t forgive being as we are.<br>
        At the last <a href="poem4.html">time.</a> , my whole life will last a <a href="poem4.html"> moment </a>.<br>
        Man is a thing children learn. A childish thing.<br>
        Don’t speak to me. I want to be with you.<br>
        There are those fallen who don’t get up so as not to fall again.<br>
        The dream that doesn’t feed on dream vanishes.<br>
