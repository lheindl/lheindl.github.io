    <h1>note to reality<br>
    by tony hoagland </h1>

    <p>

        Without even knowing it, I have <br>
believed in you for a long time.<br>

When I looked at my blood under a microscope<br>
                I could see truth multiplying over and over.<br>

—Not police sirens, nor history books, not stage-three lymphoma<br>
                                                                                     persuaded me<br>

but your honeycombs and beetles; the dry blond fascicles of grass <br>
                                                              thrust up above the January snow. <br>
Your postcards of Picasso and Matisse,<br>
                                         from the museum series on European masters. <br>

When my friend died on the way to the hospital<br>
                                           it was not his death that so amazed me<br>

but that the driver of the cab<br> 
                                              did not insist upon the fare.<br>

Quotation marks: what should we put inside them? <br>

Shall I say “I”  “have been hurt” “by”  “you,”  you neglectful monster?<br>

I speak now because experience has shown me<br>
                                 that my mind will never be clear for long.<br>
                                 <br>
I am more thick-skinned and male, more selfish, jealous, and afraid<br>
                                   than ever in my <a href="poem9.html">life.</a><br>

“For my heart is tangled in thy nets;<br>
                              my soul enmeshed in cataracts of time...”<br>

The breeze so cool today, the sky smeared with bluish grays and whites.<br>
<br>
The parade for the slain police officer<br>
goes past the bakery<br>
<br>
and the smell of fresh bread <br>
makes the mourners salivate against their will.<br>
<br>
