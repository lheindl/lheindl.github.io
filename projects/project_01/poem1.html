  <h1>The More Loving One</h1>
  <h2>BY W. H. AUDEN</h2>
  <p> Looking up at the stars, I know quite well<br>
    That, for all they care, I can go to hell,<br>
    But on earth indifference is the least<br>
    We have to dread from man or beast.<br>
    <br>
    How should we like it were stars to burn<br>
    With a passion for us we could not return?<br>
    If equally affection cannot be,<br>
    Let the more loving one be me.<br>
    <br>
    Admirer as I think I am<br>
    Of stars that do not give a damn,<br>
    I cannot, now I see them, say<br>
    I missed one terribly all day.<br>
    <br>
    Were all stars to disappear or die,<br>
    I should learn to look at an empty sky<br>
    And feel its total dark sublime<br>
    Though this might take me a little <a href="project_01/poem2.html">time.</a><br>
    </p>
