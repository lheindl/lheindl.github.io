  <h1>The More Loving One</h1>
  <h2>BY W. H. AUDEN</h2>
  <p> Looking up at the stars, I know quite well
    That, for all they care, I can go to hell,
    But on earth indifference is the least
    We have to dread from man or beast.
    
    How should we like it were stars to burn
    With a passion for us we could not return?
    If equally affection cannot be,
    Let the more loving one be me.
    
    Admirer as I think I am
    Of stars that do not give a damn,
    I cannot, now I see them, say
    I missed one terribly all day.
    
    Were all stars to disappear or die,
    I should learn to look at an empty sky
    And feel its total dark sublime
    Though this might take me a little <a id="link" href="project_01/poem2.html">time.</a>
