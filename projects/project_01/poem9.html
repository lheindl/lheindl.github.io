    <h1>life<br>
    edith wharton </h1>

    <p>

        Life, like a marble block, is given to all,<br>
        A blank, inchoate mass of years and days,<br>
        Whence one with ardent chisel swift essays<br>
        Some shape of strength or symmetry to call;<br>
        One shatters it in bits to mend a wall;<br>
        One in a craftier hand the chisel lays,<br>
        And one, to wake the mirth in Lesbia’s gaze,<br>
        Carves it apace in toys fantastical.<br>

        But least is he who, with enchanted eyes<br>
        Filled with high visions of fair shapes to be,<br>
        Muses which god he shall immortalize<br>
        In the proud Parian’s perpetuity,<br>
        Till twilight warns him from the punctual skies<br>
        That the night cometh wherein <a href="poem10.html"> none </a> shall see.<br>
