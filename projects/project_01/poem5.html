    <h1> soft <br>
    by kay ryan </h1>

    <p>

        In harmony with the rule of irony—<br>
        which requires that we harbor the enemy<br>
        on this side of the barricade—the shell<br>
        of the unborn eagle or pelican, which is made<br>
        to give protection till the great beaks can harden,<br>
        is the first thing to take up poison.<br>
        The mineral case is soft and gibbous<br>
        as the moon in a lake—an elastic,<br>
        rubbery, nightmare water that won't break.<br>
        Elsewhere, also, I see the mockeries of struggle,<br>
        a softness over <a href="poem6.html">people</a><br>
        

    </p>
