    <h1>Time</h1>
    <h2>BY JOHN WIENERS</h2>
    <p>

        Why is it eternity lasts a moment<br>
        a moment eternity?<br>
        <br>
        
        Are you quiet enough to hear horned owls<br>
        at dawn?<br>
        <br>
        I hear <a href="project_01/poem3.html"> voices </a> rustle in the leaves<br>
        after they are gone.<br>
        <br>
        New mice burst into life.   Small raccoons <br>
        bear tiny chains around their wrists.<br>
