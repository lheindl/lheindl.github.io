    <h1> moment <br>
    by caroll l. gloor </h1>

    <p>

        At the moment of my motherâ€™s death <br>
        I am rinsing frozen chicken. <br>
        No vision, no rending <br>
        of the temple curtain, only <br>
        the <a href="poem5.html"> soft </a> give of meat.<br>
        I had not seen her in four days. <br>
        I thought her better, <br>
        and the hospital did not call, <br>
        so I am fresh from <br>
        an office Christmas party, <br>
        scotch on my breath <br>
        as I answer the phone. <br>
        And in one moment all my past acts<br>
        become irrevocable.<br>

    </p>
