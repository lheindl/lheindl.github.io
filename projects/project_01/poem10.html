                You died. And because you were Greek they gave you<br>
                a coin to carry under your tongue and then also<br>
        biscuits and honey. When you came to the riverbank<br>
                you saw a crazy-looking black bumboat on the water<br>
        with a figure standing in it, lanky and dressed<br>
                darkly, holding a sweep. You were taken across,<br>
        and you gave your coin for the passage, and continued<br>
                until you came to a three-headed dog, who snarled<br>
        and threatened you, even though you were not trying<br>
                to escape. You gave him the biscuits smeared<br>
        with honey, and you passed onward to the field<br>
                of asphodel and through the gate of Tartarus. Or<br>
         <br>
        you died and you were Navajo. They had carried you<br>
                out of the hogan earlier so youâ€™d die in the sunshine.<br>
        Or if it happened inside suddenly, they stuffed up<br>
                the smokehole and boarded the front entrance, and cut<br>
        an opening in the back, the north-facing, dark-facing<br>
                side, to carry you out, and no one ever used<br>
        that hogan again. They took off your moccasins<br>
                and put them on again wrong side to, the left one<br>
        on the right foot, the right on the left, so that your<br>
                chindi would be confused and unable to <a href="index.html"> return </a><br>
        along your tracks. They washed your hair in suds<br>
                made from the yucca. Then they gave you<br>
        enough fried bread and water to last four days,<br>
                and you set off on your journey. But actually<br>
        none of these things happened. You just died.<br>
        <br>
