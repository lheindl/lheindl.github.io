    <h1>faces<br>
    by kahlil gibran </h1>

    <p>

        I have seen a face with a thousand countenances, and a face that was but a single countenance as if held in a mould.<br>
        <br>
        I have seen a face whose sheen I could look through to the ugliness beneath, and a face whose sheen I had to lift to see how beautiful it was.<br>
        <br>
        I have seen an old face much lined with nothing, and a smooth face in which all things were graven.<br>
        <br>
        I know faces, because I look through the fabric my own eye weaves, and behold the <a href="poem8.html"> reality </a> beneath.<br>
        <br>
