    <h1>people<br>
    by d.h. lawrence </h1>

    <p>

        The great gold apples of night <br>
        Hang from the street's long bough <br>
        Dripping their light <br>
        On the <a href="poem7.html"> faces </a> that drift below, <br>
        On the <a href="poem7.html"> faces </a> that drift and blow <br>
        Down the night-time, out of sight <br>
        In the wind's sad sough. <br>

        The ripeness of these apples of night <br>
        Distilling over me <br>
        Makes sickening the white <br>
        Ghost-flux of faces that hie <br>
        Them endlessly, endlessly by <br>
        Without meaning or reason why <br>
        They ever should be.<br>

        

    </p>
