    Nothing, no-thing, or no thing, is the complete absence of anything <br>
    as the opposite of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_(concept)"> something </a>and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antithesis"> antithesis </a> of everything. The concept <br>
    of nothing has been a matter of philosophical debate since at least the <br>
    5th century BC. Early Greek philosophers argued that it was impossible for <br>
    nothing to exist. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism"> atomists </a> allowed nothing but only in the spaces <br> 
    between the invisibly small atoms. For them, all space was filled with <br>
    atoms. Aristotle took the view that there exists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter"> matter </a> and there exists <br>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space">vspace </a>, a receptacle into which matter objects can be placed. This became <br>
    the paradigm for classical scientists of the modern age like Newton. <br>
    Nevertheless, some philosophers, like Descartes, continued to argue <br>
    against the existence of empty space until the scientific discovery of <br>
    a physical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum"> vacuum.</a><br>
